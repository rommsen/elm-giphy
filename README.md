# Elm project
I build this project as a learning project to learn Elm.
I am more than happy for any reviews or ideas where and how to improve.


## What is it doing?
Using the giphy search api to show gifs


## What is it based on?
* Elm (obviously)
* some webpack/babel for transpilation of ES6 and the dev-server / hot-reloading
* [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for the CSS/Flexbox magic
* https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter


## Getting started

### Installation
You need to have [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 0.18 installed on your machine.

If you have yarn installed (you should) you can just run

    yarn run installation


**Otherwise do the following:**

Install JS dependencies with:

    [yarn|npm] install

Install Elm dependencies with:

    elm package install


### Running
Start webpack-dev-server (recompiles when files change)

    [yarn|npm] run start   

Then view it:

    localhost:8080
